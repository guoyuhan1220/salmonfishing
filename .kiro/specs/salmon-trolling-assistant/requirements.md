# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Salmon Trolling Assistant is a dedicated mobile application designed specifically for fishermen to make informed decisions about their salmon trolling equipment based on current weather conditions and tide predictions. The app will integrate with weather and tide prediction services to provide real-time recommendations for the most effective flashers, lures, and leader lengths to use in specific fishing conditions. This tool aims to improve fishing success rates by leveraging data-driven recommendations tailored to the current environmental conditions. The application will prioritize a mobile-first experience, with an interface optimized for use on smartphones in outdoor fishing environments.

4. WHEN a user has logged multiple catches THEN the system SHALL incorporate this history into future recommendations.
5. WHEN a user wants to view their fishing history THEN the system SHALL display past catches with associated conditions and equipment.
6. IF a user chooses to remain anonymous THEN the system SHALL still function with generic recommendations.

### 5. Offline Functionality

**User Story:** As a fisherman in remote areas, I want basic app functionality even without internet connection, so that I can still access recommendations while on the water.
