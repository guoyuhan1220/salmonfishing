# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gen AI Chat Assistant is a versatile conversational interface that enables users to interact with large language models (LLMs), company resources (dashboards, spaces, research reports), and web content through a unified chat experience. Users can upload files to chat with their content, take actions, run workflows, and view intermediate steps during response generation. The interface supports both focus and compact modes, with features for citation viewing and source verification to enhance the trustworthiness and utility of AI-generated responses.

3. WHEN the file is being processed THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator.
4. WHEN the file processing is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user that they can now chat about the file contents.
5. WHEN the user asks questions about the uploaded file THEN the system SHALL generate responses based on the file content.
6. WHEN the file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL notify the user with supported format information.
7. IF the file exceeds the size limit THEN the system SHALL notify the user with the size limitation.

### Requirement 4: Actions and Workflows

**User Story:** As a user, I want to take actions and run workflows directly from the chat interface, so that I can accomplish tasks without switching contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

6. WHEN an action or workflow is completed THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the results.
7. IF an action or workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide error information and potential recovery steps.

### Requirement 5: Response Generation Transparency

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view intermediate steps during response generation, so that I can understand how the AI reaches its conclusions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is generating a complex response THEN the system SHALL display intermediate reasoning steps.
2. WHEN intermediate steps are displayed THEN the system SHALL format them in a way that is easy to follow.
3. WHEN the user enables or disables intermediate step viewing THEN the system SHALL respect this preference.
